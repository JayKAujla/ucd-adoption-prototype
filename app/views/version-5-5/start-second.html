      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Adoption eligibility</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can only apply to adopt a child placed in your care if the child:
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

          <li>is not married or in a civil partnership</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">You can only apply if you, or you <strong>and</strong> your partner if you both want to
          adopt, have lived
          in the UK for at least 12 months.

          <p class="govuk-body">You <strong>or</strong> your partner must also:

            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>have a fixed and permanent home in the UK, Channel Islands or the Isle of Man</li>
              <li>be 21 or older</li>


            </ul>


            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">How to apply</h2>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Information about the child</h3>

            <p class="govuk-body">You'll need the child's:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>full birth certificate </li>
              <li>placement order details </li>
            </ul>


            <p class="govuk-body">You'll also be asked about their:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>birth parents, such as name, address and occupation</li>
              <li>previous court proceedings

              <li>siblings or half-siblings</li>
            </ul>




            <div class="govuk-inset-text">Information you give about the child will only be seen by the court and
              social
              workers.</div>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Information about you</h3>

            <p class="govuk-body">You'll need to provide each applicant's:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>passport photo page
              <li> driving licence </li>
            </ul>

            <p> If relevant, you'll also need to upload:

              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                <li>your marriage or civil partnership certificate, in English or Welsh

                <li>a copy of your UK visa </li>
                <li>any passport pages that have UK immigration entry stamps
                </li>
              </ul>


              <p>There's a £170 application fee, so you'll also need a debit or credit card.</p>

              <p>You can apply to adopt 1 or more child in your care in the same application. It will be £170 for each
                application, not for each child.</p>
