                    <p class="govuk-body">The court will:</p>
                    
                    <P>- check your application and get in touch if they have questions</P>
                    <p>- ask your and the child’s social workers to finish and send their paperwork</P>
                    <p>- ask the local authority to write to all parties, including the birth parents if relevant, with the ‘initial direction’ - this includes the hearing date and things that must be done before that date (‘directions’).</P>
                    

                    <p>The birth parents have the right to ask to oppose the adoption. This can happen at any time before an adoption application is approved. If this happens, the judge will ask the birth parents to explain what has changed since the placement order was made.</p>                  </li>

                    <p>Both social workers have submitted their reports and this will then be matched to your application.</p>

                  <li>
                    <h2>The court decides</h2>
                    <p>If all the directions have been done, the hearing should happen on the date in the initial direction.</p>
                    <p> If the birth parents have asked to oppose the adoption, the judge will use this hearing to listen to their case. If there is no request to oppose, this will become the final hearing. The judge will look at your application and the social workers’ reports to make a decision.</p>
                    <p> You may go to this hearing, but usually the court will suggest you do not. This is because there’s a chance you and the birth parents could accidentally meet.</p> 
                    <p> The child cannot go to this hearing.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <h2>Adoption decision made</h2>
                    <p>If your application is successful, the court will schedule a ‘celebration hearing’ for you and the child. This blah blah blah</p>
