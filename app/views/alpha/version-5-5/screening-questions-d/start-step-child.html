      <p class="govuk-body">
        You can apply to adopt your partner's child even if their other parent is still alive.</P>


      <p>You can only apply if:
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

          <li> you've lived with the child as a family for at least 6 months</li>
          <li>you've given your local council at least 3 months' notice that you want to adopt</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
          You should talk to the other parent about your wish to adopt. If they do not consent, a court will decide if
          your application is in the child's bests interests. </div>
        <p>After you apply, the court will ask your local council to create a report on:


          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

            <li>your partner </li>
            <li>the child</li>
            <li>the other parent</li>
          </ul>


          <p> If given, the adoption court order gives you parental responsibility for the child, along with
            your partner.

            <p> The order also takes away parental responsibility from:
              <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

                <li>the childâ€™s other birth parent</li>
                <li>anyone else who has parental responsibility for the child</li>
              </ul>

              <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to apply</h2>
              <p>You'll need to post the child's long-form birth certificate. You can <a href=>get a copy</a> if you
                do not have the original.</P>
              <p class="govuk-body">You'll also need to upload 2 types of photo ID for yourself. For example, your
                passport's photo page
                and driving licence.
                </ul>

                <p> If relevant, you'll also need to upload:

                  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>the death certificate of the other parent
                    <li>a copy of your UK visa </li>
                    <li>any passport pages that have UK immigration entry stamps
                    </li>
